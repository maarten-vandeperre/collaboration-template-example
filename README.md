# collaboration-template-example
A sample project, based upon the principles of clean architecture, to showcase a template project on how you
can work together with 2 different companies on a software component.  

In case you're new to "**clean architecture / hexagonal architectures**" and its principles, it gets explained 
 [over here](https://github.com/maarten-vandeperre/clean-architecture-software-sample-project).

## Sample setup
You are an organization that's willing to contribute to our platform. 
We (i.e., the "Maarten organization") provides you with a software template, which you have to stick to.
Code within submodules can be added, changed, extended, unless the submodules are prefixed with "maarten-".
In case you doubt about you have the permission to change a submodule, check the description in the maarten-config.yaml file.
